### About Me

I am a software developer working in the [Angular](https://angular.io) and
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) ecosystem since about 2016.

I spend most of my working time on customer projects at [Exportarts](https://www.exportarts.io),
a web-design and web-development company which I co-founded in the end of 2017.
Until recently (06/2021), I was still part-time employed as a software developer at a German healthcare
provider where I started in late 2014 after I finished school.
I love to combine the knowledge and experiences from all working contexts as well as from our
clients' companies and try to create as much synergy as possible.

I am thankful for the open source community and all the tools and projects that it
provides. After all, I would not be able to follow my passion without it.
I also try to give something back whenever I see an opportunity.

As part of [our github organization](https://github.com/exportarts), I maintain a couple
of small projects which were all created while working on customer projects and that were
eventually copied to enough projects to justify creating a library.
